# S3 / Object storage

S3 can be easily tested with the included container running Minio. This is a self-hosted S3-compatible object storage server.

Start the container using the following command:

```bash
docker compose up -d minio
```

## Primary object storage

Primary object storage can be enabled by setting the `PRIMARY=minio` environment variable either in your `.env` file or in `docker-compose.yml` for individual containers.

```bash
docker compose up nextcloud minio
```

## External object storage

External storage can be configured in the Nextcloud admin settings. This is an example configuration for the `nc-external` bucket, buckets will be autocreated so you can name any bucket you like:

- Bucket: `nc-external`
- Authentication: `Access Key`
- Hostname: `minio`
- Port: `9000`
- Enable SSL: `No`
- Enable Path Style: `Yes`
- Legacy (v2) Authentication: `No`
- Access Key: `nextcloud`
- Secret Key: `nextcloud`

## Accessing Minio

Minio can be accessed via the browser at <http://minio.local> with the following credentials:

- Username: `nextcloud`
- Password: `nextcloud`

## Using mc command line

This can be useful for admin operations like setting a bucket quota on the `nc-external` bucket name:

```
docker compose exec minio mc alias set minio http://localhost:9000 nextcloud nextcloud
docker compose exec minio mc quota set minio/nc-external --size 1k
