# Mail

Sending mails from Nextcloud usually requires an email server and account to be configured. This setup provides a [mailhog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) installation that is autoconfigured, so you can browse all mails sent from Nextcloud in the webui by opening [mail.local](http://mail.local) in your browser.
