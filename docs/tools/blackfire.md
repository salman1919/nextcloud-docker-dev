# Blackfire

Blackfire needs to use a hostname/ip that is resolvable from within the Blackfire container. Their free version is [limited to local profiling](https://support.blackfire.io/troubleshooting/hack-edition-users-cannot-profile-non-local-http-applications), so we need to browse Nextcloud though its local docker IP or add the hostname to `/etc/hosts`.

By default, the PHP module for Blackfire is disabled, but you can enable or disable this through the following script:

```
./scripts/php-mod-config nextcloud blackfire on
```

After that you can use Blackfire through the browser plugin or curl as described below.

### Using with curl

```
alias blackfire='docker compose exec -e BLACKFIRE_CLIENT_ID=$BLACKFIRE_CLIENT_ID -e BLACKFIRE_CLIENT_TOKEN=$BLACKFIRE_CLIENT_TOKEN blackfire blackfire'
blackfire curl http://192.168.21.8/
```
